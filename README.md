# PRODIGY_WD_03: Tic-Tac-Toe Web Application

An interactive, logic-based Tic-Tac-Toe game developed as part of the Web Development Internship at Prodigy Infotech.

## 🕹️ Overview
This project is a web-based implementation of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game. It features a clean user interface and robust game logic to handle player turns, win detection, and draw scenarios.

## ✨ Features
- **Dynamic Turn Switching**: Seamlessly alternates between Player X and Player O.
- **Win Detection**: Algorithms check for 8 possible winning combinations after every move.
- **Draw Condition**: Automatically detects when the board is full with no winner.
- **Game Reset**: One-click functionality to clear the board and start a new match.
- **Responsive Grid**: Built using CSS Grid for a sharp, centered layout on all screen sizes.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **HTML5**: For the semantic structure of the game board.
- **CSS3**: Utilized CSS Grid and Flexbox for precise layout and styling.
- **JavaScript (Vanilla)**: For the core game engine, state management, and DOM manipulation.
